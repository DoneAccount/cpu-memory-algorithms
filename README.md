## 🚀 Project Overview
This project explores key **Operating System concepts** by simulating various **CPU Scheduling** and **Memory Management (Paging)** algorithms.  
It demonstrates how different scheduling and page replacement strategies affect performance and system efficiency.

---

## 💻 Included Algorithms

### CPU Scheduling
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin (RR)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)

### Memory Management
- Optimal Page Replacement
- Least Recently Used (LRU) Page Replacement

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, or Eclipse).  
2. Locate and **run `Main.java`** to start the simulation.

---

## 📝 Notes
- Ensure all `.java` files are compiled before execution.  
- Each algorithm can be modified and tested independently.

*Developed for the course **Operating System Fundamentals** to demonstrate core CPU and Memory Management algorithms through simulation.*
